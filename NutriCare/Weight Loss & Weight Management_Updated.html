        <h2>What is Weight Loss & Weight Management?</h2>
        <p>Weight loss and weight management involve making healthy lifestyle changes to achieve and maintain a desired body weight. These changes typically include improvements to diet, physical activity, and overall mental well-being. Successful weight management is not about quick fixes, but about sustainable changes that promote long-term health.</p>

            <li><span class="highlight">Regular Exercise:</span> Incorporating physical activity, whether through cardio, strength training, or flexibility exercises, to burn calories and improve fitness.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Mental Well-Being:</span> Developing a positive relationship with food, managing stress, and practicing mindfulness to avoid emotional eating.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sustainable Goals:</span> Setting realistic, measurable goals that focus on gradual weight loss, rather than rapid, unhealthy results.</li>

            <li><span class="highlight">Sustainability:</span> Achieving long-term weight loss involves making small, gradual changes that fit into your lifestyle, avoiding drastic diets that can be difficult to maintain.</li>
