       <h2> Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
       <ul type="disc">
        <h3><em>Let's start with the obvious: a skirt steak!</em></h3>
        <li><span><b>Selection Tips:</b></span>
           look for “inside skirt steak” or “skirt steak” at the meat counter or wherever you're shopping.<br>
            You'll see it labeled both ways, but it's the same cut. It comes<br>
             from a primal beef cut that also includes the “outside skirt steak”
        </li>
        <li><span><b>What to Look For</b></span>
            Try to find a piece that's at least 1 to 1 1/4 lbs for this skirt steak salad<br>
            recipe. This cut is long and flat, with a thick grain and some marbling. <br>
            Trim it if you need to but a good butcher will do this for you.

        </li>
        <li><span><b>Seasoning Tips: </b></span>
            Despite its smaller size, skirt steak is big on beef flavor. That's what I'm<br>
            going for in a steak salad, so I use very minimal seasoning. A little salt,<br>
             a little black pepper, or a little bit of your favorite steak seasoning should be just fine.
        </li>
       
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc" >
        <h3><em>In addition to the skirt steak, you'll also need:</em></h3>
        <li><span><b>Preshredded or chopped veggies.</b></span>
            There's no lettuce component for this steak salad<br>
            or matchstick carrots. All of these options can be found in the produce section of <br>
            most grocery stores and will save you tons of time chopping and slicing.
         </li>
        <li><span><b>Red bell pepper and green onions. </b></span>
            But speaking of slicing, you will have to do some<br>
            minor prep work for these. This salad will still work without them but I think you'll really <br>
            enjoy the bright colors and flavor. 
         </li>
        <li><span><b>Crunchy garnishes,</b></span>
            like toasted sesame seeds, crispy wonton strips, and roasted <br>
            peanuts </li>
            <li><span><b>Miso and grated ginger</b></span>
                or the dressing, plus a neutral-flavored oil, toasted sesame oil, <br>
                rice vinegar, and garlic for the dressing.</li>
     </ul>

   <h2> How To Make Skirt Steak Salad</h2>
    
   <p>Lightly season the steak you plan to use for this steak salad recipe and get your grill pan,<br>
    cast iron, or grill top nice and hot. Wait until it's heated, then carefully lay the skirt steak on<br>
    the grilling surface. Set a timer for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes (or more for thicker cuts). Then flip and<br>
    cook for another 2 1/2 to 3 minutes on the other side.<br>
 </p>
 <p>Once done, use a clean pair of tongs to move it over to a cutting board. Wait at least five<br>
     minutes before slicing. In the meantime, you can prep the salad ingredients.</p>

    <p>
        The dressing couldn't be easier, especially if you have a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Just add<br>
         all the ingredients, seal it up, and give it a nice shake. If you don't have that option, you can<br>
          also use a small prep bowl and a fork or whisk to combine everything.
    </p>
    
    <p>Set that aside and rinse off the red bell pepper and green onions. Pat dry, then slice. <br>
        It doesn't need to be perfect, although I really like nice thick slices of green onion for salads.<br>
          Use both the green and white portions for stronger flavor, or only the green tops for more<br>
           mild flavor. Add them to a large mixing bowl with the broccoli slaw, shredded cabbage, and<br>
            shredded carrots. Then just toss everything together until it's evenly mixed.<br>
