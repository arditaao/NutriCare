    <h2> Pre-Diabetes</h2>

            Sometimes patients get told they have “prediabetes” or a “high risk” of developing type 2 diabetes. This can be very scary and confusing.<br> 
            Prediabetes basically means that a person's blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be officially “type 2 diabetes”.<br>
            In the UK, typically an HbA1C test is used and if it is 42-47mmol/mol, this is considered prediabetes.<br> 
            Firstly, it's worth mentioning that the term “prediabetes” is a pretty controversial one in the diabetes world.<br> 
            This is because the name suggests that people with prediabetes will go on to develop type 2 diabetes fairly imminently.<br>This isn't true.
            <br> 
            Statistics show that of 100 people with prediabetes, over the course of a year, one third will develop type 2 diabetes,<br> 
            one third will stay in the prediabetes range, and a third which actually go back to normal blood glucose levels. <br>
             Secondly, prediabetes actually describes different conditions.<br>A person's blood sugar can be high in the fasting state, or high after a meal or both.<br>
              Unfortunately, the HbA1c that is used by a GP practices to identify prediabetes cannot discriminate between these conditions.<br>
            This information is really important to know, because you may have been given the impression you need to “lose weight to prevent type 2 diabetes”,
             however, this is not always the case.

        <li><span><b>Type 2 Diabetes Remission</b></span>
            Type 2 diabetes develops mainly because of two separate problems: the first is that the pancreas does not make enough insulin, <br>
            and the second is that there is in insulin resistance (this mean that insulin does not work very well). <br>
            There are also other changes which are important which include an impaired ability to oxidise fat - might lead to fat building up in places it shouldn’t (like the liver or pancreas).<br>
            We have moved from “managing” the condition lifelong to putting the condition into remission.<br>
             Remission in this context means that a patient has normal blood sugar levels and no longer needs their sugar-lowering medications.<br>
              We use the term remission and not reversal here. <br>
            This is deliberate as “reversal” misrepresents what is happening, and might give patients false hope. <br>
            We know that people can achieve normalisation of blood sugar levels, and can come off their sugar-lowering medications.<br>
             For many people this can last for years. But we also know that some people can achieve normal blood sugar levels for a short period of time,
              but for reasons we don't understand, their blood sugar creeps up again.<br>
             Remission helps medical professionals and the patient understand that this is something to keep an eye on, <br>
             so we can work together to help prevent any complications from developing.
