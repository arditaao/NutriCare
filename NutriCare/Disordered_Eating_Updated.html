        <h2>Understanding Disordered Eating</h2>
        <p>Disordered eating refers to irregular eating behaviors that may not qualify as a diagnosed eating disorder but still impact physical and mental well-being. Unlike a formally diagnosed eating disorder, disordered eating patterns can appear in individuals of all body types and often involve an unhealthy focus on food, weight, and dieting.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Emotional Eating:</span> Using food to cope with emotions rather than for hunger.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Compulsive Eating:</span> Feeling out of control with food intake, often leading to guilt.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Anxiety Around Food:</span> Avoiding social events due to fear of food choices.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Obsession with Food & Weight:</span> Spending excessive time worrying about food intake and body image.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What is an Eating Disorder?</h2>
        <p>Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions that affect people of all backgrounds. They involve unhealthy relationships with food and body image and can have severe physical consequences.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Anorexia Nervosa:</span> Characterized by extreme food restriction, weight loss, and an intense fear of gaining weight.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Bulimia Nervosa:</span> Involves binge eating followed by purging behaviors such as vomiting or excessive exercise.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Binge Eating Disorder:</span> Regular episodes of eating large amounts of food without purging.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Orthorexia:</span> An obsession with healthy eating that leads to severe food restrictions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with disordered eating or an eating disorder, seeking help from a medical professional is crucial. Recovery is possible with the right support and guidance.</p>
