        <h2> Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <h3><em>Here are the key ingredients you'll need to make this braised beef recipe: </em></h3>
            <li><span><b>Beef cuts like shorts ribs, oxtails, stew meat, or neck bones. </b></span>
                Depending on the cost<br>
                and availability, any of these cuts can work. The general cooking process is the same,<br>
                but you may want to adjust the cooking times. For example, stew meat may need<br>
                longer or shorter cooking times depending on the size of the pieces and how lean they<br>
                are.
            </li>
            <li><span><b>Aromatic vegetables.</b></span>
                You can't go wrong with the classic combo of onions, carrots,<br>
                and celery. Try to use a large onion plus two medium carrots and two medium stalks of<br>
                celery for an ideal ratio. However, it doesn't need to be exact so just use what you have!<br>
                Just don't forget to include the garlic cloves and fresh ginger pieces.
             </li>
            <li><span><b>Dried spices. </b></span>
                This is where all the flavor comes from for the braising liquid<br>
                Peppercorns, green cardamom pods, star anise, Ceylon cinnamon sticks, cloves, and a<br>
                bay leaf or two will infuse an incredible amount of flavor into your recipe, plus make<br>
                your kitchen smell amazing!
               </li>
               <li><span><b>Pomegranate juice. </b></span>
                Since this is a braised beef recipe without wine, we still need some<br>
                kind of liquid for deglazing the pan. It's fine to use more of the beef broth, but I really<br>
                recommend including the pomegranate juice if you can. The rest goes into the<br>
                 pomegranate glaze, so you'll definitely use an entire bottle without it going to waste!
                </li>
         <p>Beyond that, use some beef broth or stock (homemade or store bought) and oyster sauce<br>
                    to round out the ingredient list. I also recommend serving it with something like white rice <br>
                    when it's finished.<br>

   <h2> How To Make Braised Beef Without Wine</h2>
    
   <p>If you've never tried braising beef before, stick around! If you have, feel free to jump ahead<br>
    to the recipe. But this process is easy to master and will forever change the way you cook<br>
    with beef in recipes like this.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <h3><em>Here's a primer on how to do it:</em></h3>
    <li>Pat your meat dry and season generously with salt. If you're worried about using “too<br>
        much” just know you could probably stand to use a little more.<br>
    </li>
   <li> Heat some oil in your Dutch oven. Once heated, brown the beef on all sides until it's<br>
    golden brown and crisped. If you need to, work in batches to avoid overcrowding your<br>
    pan. You want to keep the heat high enough to achieve browning, not just cooking the<br>
     outside edges of your beef.
    </li>
    <li> Transfer the browned beef to a platter or bowl to free up the Dutch oven. Add your<br>
        aromatics (in this case, onions, carrots, and celery). Cook for at least 5-6 minutes or until<br>
        the edges start to brown, too. Then add your garlic and ginger to start infusing those<br>
       flavors,too
     </li>
    <li> By this time, you'll have some browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add a small<br>
        amount of liquid to “deglaze” or release those cooked-on bits. Most recipes call for red<br>
        wine, which pairs nicely with beef. However, for this braised beef recipe we're using<br>
        pomegranate juice instead. Use a wooden spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan and<br>
         once simmering, add the rest of the liquid and dried spices.
    </li>
   <li> Once you've poured the beef broth in, add the browned beef back. The liquid may not <br>
    fully cover the beef. Reduce the heat to low so it doesn't boil over.
   </li>
   <li>Cover and cook for at least two hours. At that point, you can remove the lid and test it to <br>
    see if the beef is tender enough to slide off the bone. If not, let it go for another 30 <br>
     minutes or so and check again.

   </li>
   </ol>

   <p>That's pretty much it! While the process may seem intimidating or too long to be worth it,<br>
     don't let that stop you. The wait is definitely worth it, especially since the majority of work is<br>
      done up front.
