        <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><span><b>Old-fashioned or rolled oats.</b></span>
                Did you know these are the same type of oat? In fact,
                they're the same as quick or instant oats, only in a different shape. Nutritionally, they're
                all pretty similar but cooking times and texture will differ. I like the hearty texture of old-
                fashioned oats, so that's why I chose them for this oat bar recipe.
            </li><br>
            <li><span><b>Fresh cranberries.</b></span>
                Luckily, you can probably find bags of fresh cranberries almost year-
                round at this point, but if you're not baking these cranberry oat bars during the winter
                season, try swapping for frozen cranberries (just be sure to thaw them first).
             </li><br>
            <li><span><b>Unsalted butter.</b></span>
                You need two sticks for the browned butter. I really suggest taking the
                extra time to brown the butter but if you're in a big hurry, just fully melt
                 the butter instead.
               </li><br>
               <li><span><b>Sliced almonds.</b></span>
                Almonds make a delicious flavor pairing for oranges, cranberries, and
                baking spices. I like the sliced texture, but if you have chopped or slivered almonds, go
                ahead and use what you have.
                </li><br>
                <li><span><b>Sliced almonds.</b></span>
                    Orange zest. I zested an entire navel orange, which yields about two tablespoons.
                    </li>
        </ul>
          
            <p>In addition to these key ingredients, you need some baking staples: all-purpose flour, white
                granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. And don't
                 forget extra old-fashioned oats to make some oat flour!

   <h2> How do I make my own oat flour?</h2>
    
   <p>No need to make a special purchase, it's super simple to make your own oat flour at home!</p>
   <p>I just load one cup of old-fashioned oats into my nutribullet food processor.<br> It has powerful
    blades and multiple speed settings, so pulverizing oats into a coarse flour is a piece of cake!<br>
    If you plan to do a lot of baking, use the large 7-cup capacity bowl to make several batches.<br>
    Store extra oat flour in the fridge to prolong its shelf life and you can enjoy baking many
    more recipes like these cranberry oat bars.

 <h2> How To Make Orange Cranberry Oatmeal Bars</h2>
   <p>First, prep your baking dish. <br> The baking time for this cranberry oat bar recipe is based on a
       9″x9″ square baking pan. <br> Line it with parchment paper, trimming it down to size. <br>Leave a
      little bit of overhang on two of the side, which will make it much easier to remove the bars
      after baking. <br>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
</p>

    <p>In addition to using the food processor for the oat flour, you can use it to blend the fresh
        cranberries with sugar and orange zest. Pulse or blend on low speed until you get a chunky
        consistency.

 <p>After that, just combine the dry ingredients plus the vanilla and browned butter in a mixing
    bowl. <br> Stir together until you get a crumbly mixture, then transfer about half of it to your
    prepared baking dish. Use the back of a spatula or clean hands to press it into the corners,
    creating an even layer across the bottom.
</p>

    <p>
        Next, add the cranberry mixture and repeat, spreading it evenly into all corners.
