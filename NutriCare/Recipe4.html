        <h2>How to Make Korean Strawberry Milk</h2>
        
        <p><em>Strawberry Milk is a popular drink in South Korea, especially during hot summer months. The chunks of strawberries in this recipe help keep it more authentic.</em></p>

        <p>First, start with fresh strawberries. Why fresh? Well, using frozen strawberries could still work. But when I was testing this recipe for Korean Strawberry Milk, the frozen berries released more liquid as they cooked down. The puree didn't get nearly as syrupy or sticky, which is helpful if you want that colorful glass when you serve it. If that's not important to you, or you just don't have time or fresh berries, just smash frozen berries together with the sugar. It's no problem!</p>

        <h3><em>Cooking Down Fresh Strawberries</em></h3>
        <p>If you are cooking down fresh strawberries, remove the stems after washing and drying the strawberries. Give them a rough chop so they look similar to the photo above. It doesn't have to be perfectly uniform because once you start cooking them down, they'll soften and change shape anyways. And that's the goal, because I think this Korean Strawberry Milk is best enjoyed through a straw. There's nothing worse than trying to suck something through a straw and getting it stuck halfway up!</p>

        <p>Heat the strawberries with the sugar in a skillet or saucepan. Stir occasionally, especially once the mixture starts to bubble. After about 10 minutes, it should start to thicken and get sticky. It will get a little thicker as it cools in the fridge, so it's ideal to do this the day before. But again, it won't impact the flavor, so do whatever works best for you!</p>
