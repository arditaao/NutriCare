        <h3><em>What is Coeliac Disease and what are some of the Treatments? </em></h3>
        <li><span><b>Coeliac Disease</b></span>
          Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition that leads to<br>
           damage of the small intestine when minimal amounts of gluten<br>
            are consumed. This condition affects 1 in 100 people in the UK.<br>
            <br>
            When somebody who has coeliac disease eats gluten, their body<br>
             ends up attacking itself and damaging the lining of the small<br>
              intestine and this can cause a very large range of symptoms<br>
               both inside and outside the gut. This gut damage can also lead<br>
                to further complications if the gluten free diet is not followed correctly.<br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, not every person will respond the same way to the<br>
                gluten free diet and some people can have ongoing symptoms<br>
                 despite following the gluten free diet.<br>
                 <br>
                 It is important to get support from a health professional well versed in coeliac disease to troubleshoot these problems and get<br> to the root cause.
                 <br><br>
                 According to national UK health guidelines, coeliac disease patients should also have an annual blood tests (mainly to check<br>
                for gut absorption) and an appointment with a health professional as well as check-ups for their bone health.
